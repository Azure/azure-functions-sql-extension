# Output Binding

## SqlAttribute for Output Bindings

The output binding takes a list of rows to be upserted into a user table. If the primary key value of the row already exists in the table, the row is interpreted as an update, meaning that the values of the other columns in the table for that primary key are updated. If the primary key value does not exist in the table, the row is interpreted as an insert. The upserting of the rows is batched by the output binding code.

  > **NOTE:** By default the Output binding uses the T-SQL [MERGE](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/merge-transact-sql) statement which requires [SELECT](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/t-sql/statements/merge-transact-sql#permissions) permissions on the target database.

The output binding takes two [arguments](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-sql-extension/blob/main/src/SqlAttribute.cs):

- **CommandText**: Passed as a constructor argument to the binding. Represents the name of the table into which rows will be upserted.
- **ConnectionStringSetting**: Specifies the name of the app setting that contains the SQL connection string used to connect to a database. The connection string must follow the format specified [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.data.sqlclient.sqlconnection.connectionstring?view=sqlclient-dotnet-core-2.0).

The following are valid binding types for the rows to be upserted into the table:

- **ICollector&lt;T&gt;/IAsyncCollector&lt;T&gt;**: Each element is a row represented by `T`, where `T` is a user-defined POCO, or Plain Old C# Object. `T` should follow the structure of a row in the queried table. See the [Query String](./InputBinding.md#query-string) for an example of what `T` should look like.
- **T**: Used when just one row is to be upserted into the table.
- **T[]**: Each element is again a row of the result represented by `T`. This output binding type requires manual instantiation of the array in the function.

The repo contains examples of each of these binding types [here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-sql-extension/tree/main/samples/samples-csharp/OutputBindingSamples). A few examples are also included [below](#samples).

## Setup

### .NET

Note: This tutorial requires that a SQL database is setup as shown in [Create a SQL Server](./QuickStart.md#create-a-sql-server), and that you have the 'Employee.cs' class from the [Input Binding Guide](./InputBinding.md#net).

- Open your app in VS Code
- Press 'F1' and search for 'Azure Functions: Create Function'
- Choose HttpTrigger ->  (Provide a function name) -> Company.namespace is fine -> anonymous
- In the file that opens, replace the `public static async Task<IActionResult> Run` block with the below code

    ```csharp
    public static IActionResult Run(
        [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", Route = "addemployees-array")]
        HttpRequest req, ILogger log,
        [Sql("dbo.Employees",
        ConnectionStringSetting = "SqlConnectionString")]
        out Employee[] output)
    {
        output = new Employee[]
            {
                new Employee
                {
                    EmployeeId = 1,
                    FirstName = "Hello",
                    LastName = "World",
                    Company = "Microsoft",
                    Team = "Functions"
                },
                new Employee
                {
                    EmployeeId = 2,
                    FirstName = "Hi",
                    LastName = "SQLupdate",
                    Company = "Microsoft",
                    Team = "Functions"
                },
            };

        return new CreatedResult($"/api/addemployees-array", output);
    }
    ```

    *In the above, "dbo.Employees" is the name of the table our output binding is upserting into. The line below is similar to the input binding and specifies where our SqlConnectionString is. For more information on this, see the [SqlAttribute for Output Bindings](#sqlattribute-for-output-bindings) section*

- Hit 'F5' to run your code. Click the link to upsert the output array values in your SQL table. Your upserted values should launch in the browser.
- Congratulations! You have successfully created your first SQL output binding!

### Javascript

Note: This tutorial requires that a SQL database is setup as shown in [Create a SQL Server](./QuickStart.md#create-a-sql-server).

- Open your app in VS Code
- Press 'F1' and search for 'Azure Functions: Create Function'
- Choose HttpTrigger ->  (Provide a function name) -> anonymous
- In the file that opens (`index.js`), replace the `module.exports = async function (context, req)` block with the below code.

    ```javascript
    module.exports = async function (context, req) {
        const employees = [
            {
                EmployeeId : 1,
                FirstName : "Hello",
                LastName : "World",
                Company : "Microsoft",
                Team : "Functions"
            },
            {
                EmployeeId : 2,
                FirstName : "Hi",
                LastName : "SQLupdate",
                Company : "Microsoft",
                Team : "Functions"
            }
        ];
        context.bindings.employee = employees;

        return {
            status: 201,
            body: employees
        };
    }
    ```

- We also need to add the SQL output binding for the `context.bindings.employee` property. Open the function.json file.
- Paste the below in the file as an additional entry to the "bindings": [] array.

    ```json
    {
      "name": "employee",
      "type": "sql",
      "direction": "out",
      "commandText": "dbo.Employees",
      "connectionStringSetting": "SqlConnectionString"
    }
    ```
    *In the above, "dbo.Employees" is the name of the table our output binding is upserting into. The line below is similar to the input binding and specifies where our SqlConnectionString is. For more information on this, see the [SqlAttribute for Output Bindings](#sqlattribute-for-output-bindings) section*

- Hit 'F5' to run your code. Click the link to upsert the output array values in your SQL table. Your upserted values should launch in the browser.
- Congratulations! You have successfully created your first SQL output binding!

### Python

Note: This tutorial requires that a SQL database is setup as shown in [Create a SQL Server](./QuickStart.md#create-a-sql-server).

- Open your app in VS Code
- Press 'F1' and search for 'Azure Functions: Create Function'
- Choose HttpTrigger ->  (Provide a function name) -> anonymous
- In the file that opens (`__init__.py`), replace the `def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:` block with the below code.

    ```python
    def main(req: func.HttpRequest, employee: func.Out[func.SqlRow]) -> func.HttpResponse:
        newEmployee = {
            EmployeeId = 1,
            FirstName = "Hello",
            LastName = "World",
            Company = "Microsoft",
            Team = "Functions"
        }
        row = func.SqlRow(newEmployee)
        employee.set(row);

        return func.HttpResponse(
            body=json.dumps(newEmployee),
            status_code=201,
            mimetype="application/json"
        )
    ```

- Add an import json statement to the top of the file.
- We also need to add the SQL output binding for the `context.bindings.employee` property. Open the function.json file.
- Paste the below in the file as an additional entry to the "bindings": [] array.

    ```json
    {
      "name": "employee",
      "type": "sql",
      "direction": "out",
      "commandText": "dbo.Employees",
      "connectionStringSetting": "SqlConnectionString"

                HttpRequestMessage<Optional<String>> request,
            @SQLOutput(
                commandText = "dbo.Employees",
                connectionStringSetting = "SqlConnectionString")
                OutputBinding<Employee[]> output) {
        output = new Employee[]
            {
                new Employee(1, "Hello", "World", "Microsoft", "Functions"),
                new Employee(2, "Hi", "SQLupdate", "Microsoft", "Functions")
            };

## Samples

### ICollector&lt;T&gt;/IAsyncCollector&lt;T&gt;

When using an `ICollector`, it is not necessary to instantiate it. The function can add rows to the `ICollector` directly, and its contents are automatically upserted once the function exits.

 ```csharp
[FunctionName("AddProductsCollector")]
public static IActionResult Run(
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", Route = "addproducts-collector")] HttpRequest req,
[Sql("Products", ConnectionStringSetting = "SqlConnectionString")] ICollector<Product> products)
{
    var newProducts = GetNewProducts(5000);
    foreach (var product in newProducts)
    {
        products.Add(product);
    }
    return new CreatedResult($"/api/addproducts-collector", "done");
}
```

It is also possible to force an upsert within the function by calling `FlushAsync()` on an `IAsyncCollector`

```csharp
[FunctionName("AddProductsAsyncCollector")]
public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", Route = "addproducts-asynccollector")] HttpRequest req,
[Sql("Products", ConnectionStringSetting = "SqlConnectionString")] IAsyncCollector<Product> products)
{
    var newProducts = GetNewProducts(5000);
    foreach (var product in newProducts)
    {
        await products.AddAsync(product);
    }
    // Rows are upserted here
    await products.FlushAsync();

    newProducts = GetNewProducts(5000);
    foreach (var product in newProducts)
    {
        await products.AddAsync(product);
    }
    return new CreatedResult($"/api/addproducts-collector", "done");
}
```

### Array

This output binding type requires explicit instantiation within the function body. Note also that the `Product[]` array must be prefixed by `out` when attached to the output binding

``` csharp
[FunctionName("AddProductsArray")]
public static IActionResult Run(
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", Route = "addproducts-array")]
    HttpRequest req,
[Sql("dbo.Products", ConnectionStringSetting = "SqlConnectionString")] out Product[] output)
{
    // Suppose that the ProductID column is the primary key in the Products table, and the
    // table already contains a row with ProductID = 1. In that case, the row will be updated
    // instead of inserted to have values Name = "Cup" and Cost = 2.
    output = new Product[2];
    var product = new Product();
    product.ProductID = 1;
    product.Name = "Cup";
    product.Cost = 2;
    output[0] = product;
    product = new Product();
    product.ProductID = 2;
    product.Name = "Glasses";
    product.Cost = 12;
    output[1] = product;
    return new CreatedResult($"/api/addproducts-array", output);
}
```

### Single Row

When binding to a single row, it is also necessary to prefix the row with `out`

```csharp
[FunctionName("AddProduct")]
public static IActionResult Run(
[HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", Route = "addproduct")]
    HttpRequest req,
[Sql("Products", ConnectionStringSetting = "SqlConnectionString")] out Product product)
{
    product = new Product
    {
        Name = req.Query["name"],
        ProductID = int.Parse(req.Query["id"]),
        Cost = int.Parse(req.Query["cost"])
    };
    return new CreatedResult($"/api/addproduct", product);
}
```

## Primary Key Special Cases

Typically Output Bindings require two things :

1. The table being upserted to contains a Primary Key constraint (composed of one or more columns)
2. Each of those columns must be present in the POCO object used in the attribute

Normally either of these are false then an error will be thrown. Below are the situations in which this is not the case :

### Identity Columns
In the case where one of the primary key columns is an identity column, there are two options based on how the function defines the output object:

1. If the identity column isn't included in the output object then a straight insert is always performed with the other column values. See [AddProductWithIdentityColumn](../samples/samples-csharp/OutputBindingSamples/AddProductWithIdentityColumn.cs) for an example.
2. If the identity column is included (even if it's an optional nullable value) then a merge is performed similar to what happens when no identity column is present. This merge will either insert a new row or update an existing row based on the existence of a row that matches the primary keys (including the identity column). See [AddProductWithIdentityColumnIncluded](../samples/samples-csharp/OutputBindingSamples/AddProductWithIdentityColumnIncluded.cs) for an example.

### Columns with Default Values
In the case where one of the primary key columns has a default value, there are also two options based on how the function defines the output object:
1. If the column with a default value is not included in the output object, then a straight insert is always performed with the other values. See [AddProductWithDefaultPK](../samples/samples-csharp/OutputBindingSamples/AddProductWithDefaultPK.cs) for an example.
2. If the column with a default value is included then a merge is performed similar to what happens when no default column is present. If there is a nullable column with a default value, then the provided column value in the output object will be upserted even if it is null.
