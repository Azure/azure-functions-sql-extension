# Quick Start

This document contains all the initial setup instructions needed to make your own Azure Function with SQL Bindings.

## Create a SQL Server

First, you'll need a SQL server for the bindings to connect to. If you already have your own set up then you can skip this step, otherwise pick from one of the below options.

### Docker container

SQL Server on Docker makes it easy to set up and connect to a locally hosted instance of SQL Server. Instructions for getting started can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-docker-container-deployment).

### Azure SQL Database

Azure SQL Database is a fully managed platform as a service (PaaS) database engine that runs the latest stable version of the Microsoft SQL Server database engine. Instructions for getting started can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/single-database-create-quickstart).

## SQL Setup

Next, you'll configure your SQL Server database for use with Azure SQL binding for Azure Functions.

This will require connecting to and running queries - you can use [Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio) or the [MSSQL for VS Code Extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/tools/visual-studio-code/sql-server-develop-use-vscode) to do this.

1. First, you'll need a table to run queries against. If you already have one you'd like to use then you can skip this step.

    Otherwise connect to your database and run the following query to create a simple table to start with.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
        EmployeeId int,
        FirstName varchar(255),
        LastName varchar(255),
        Company varchar(255),
        Team varchar(255)
);
```

1. Next a primary key must be set in your SQL table before using the bindings. To do this, run the queries below, replacing the placeholder values for your table and column.

```sql
ALTER TABLE ['{table_name}'] ALTER COLUMN ['{primary_key_column_name}'] int NOT NULL

ALTER TABLE ['{table_name}'] ADD CONSTRAINT PKey PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED (['{primary_key_column_name}']);
```

## Create Login and User

SQL bindings connect to the target database by using a Connection String configured in the app settings. This will require a login be created that the function will use to access the server.

For local testing and development using a SQL (username/password) or Azure Active Directory Login is typically the easiest, but for deployed function apps it is recommended to use [Azure Active Directory Managed Authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-identity-access-azure-sql-with-managed-identity).

## Assign Permissions

The login used by the function will need to have the following permissions assigned to the user it's mapped to in order for it to successfully interact with the database. The permissions required for each type of binding is listed below.

### Input Binding Permissions

The permissions required by input bindings depend on the query being executed.

#### Text Query Input Binding Permissions

For text query input bindings you will need the permissions required to execute the statement, which will usually be `SELECT` on the object you're retrieving rows from.

```sql
USE <DatabaseName>
GRANT SELECT ON <ObjectName> TO <UserName>
```

#### Stored Procedure Input Binding Permissions

For stored procedure input bindings you will need `EXECUTE` permissions on the stored procedure.

```sql
USE <DatabaseName>
GRANT EXECUTE ON <StoredProcedureName> TO <UserName>
```

### Output Binding Permissions

- `SELECT`, `INSERT`, and `UPDATE` permissions on the table

These are required to retrieve metadata and update the rows in the table.

```sql
USE <DatabaseName>
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON <TableName> TO <UserName>
```

**NOTE**: In some scenarios, the presence of table components such as a  SQL DML trigger may require additional permissions for the output binding to successfully complete the operation.

## Create a Function Project

Now you will need a Function Project to add the binding to. If you have one created already you can skip this step.

These steps can be done in the Terminal/CLI or with PowerShell.

1. Install [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local)

2. Create a function project for .NET, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, or PowerShell.

    **.NET**

    ```bash
    mkdir MyApp
    cd MyApp
    func init --worker-runtime dotnet
    ```

    **JavaScript (NodeJS)**

    ```bash
    mkdir MyApp
    cd MyApp
    func init --worker-runtime node --language javascript
    ```

    **TypeScript (NodeJS)**

    ```bash
    mkdir MyApp
    cd MyApp
    func init --worker-runtime node --language typescript
    ```

    **Python**

    ```bash
    mkdir MyApp
    cd MyApp
    func init --worker-runtime python
    ```

    **Java**

    ```bash
    mkdir MyApp
    cd MyApp
    func init --worker-runtime java
    ```

    **PowerShell**

    ```bash
    mkdir MyApp
    cd MyApp
    func init --worker-runtime powershell
    ```

3. Enable SQL bindings on the function project. More information can be found in the [Azure SQL bindings for Azure Functions docs](https://aka.ms/sqlbindings).

    **.NET:** Install the extension.

    ```powershell
    dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Sql --prerelease
    ```

    **JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, PowerShell:** Update the `host.json` file to the preview extension bundle.

    ```json
    "extensionBundle": {
        "id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle.Preview",
        "version": "[4.*, 5.0.0)"
    }
    ```

    **Java:**
    Update the `host.json` file to the preview extension bundle.

    ```json
    "extensionBundle": {
        "id": "Microsoft.Azure.Functions.ExtensionBundle.Preview",
        "version": "[4.*, 5.0.0)"
    }
    ```

    Add the `azure-functions-java-library-sql` dependency to the pom.xml file.

    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.microsoft.azure.functions</groupId>
        <artifactId>azure-functions-java-library-sql</artifactId>
        <version>0.1.0</version>
    </dependency>
    ```

## Configure Function Project

Once you have your Function Project you need to configure it for use with Azure SQL bindings for Azure Functions.

1. Ensure you have Azure Storage Emulator running. This is specific to the sample functions in this repository with a non-HTTP trigger. For information on the Azure Storage Emulator, refer to the docs on its use in [functions local development](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-app-settings#azurewebjobsstorage) and [installation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-use-emulator#get-the-storage-emulator).

2. Get your SQL connection string

   <details>
   <summary>Local SQL Server</summary>
   - Use this connection string, replacing the placeholder values for the database and password.</br>
    </br>
    <code>Server=localhost;Initial Catalog={db_name};Persist Security Info=False;User ID=sa;Password={your_password};</code>
   </details>

   <details>
   <summary>Azure SQL Server</summary>
   - Browse to the SQL Database resource in the <a href="https://ms.portal.azure.com/">Azure portal</a></br>
   - In the left blade click on the <b>Connection Strings</b> tab</br>
   - Copy the <b>SQL Authentication</b> connection string</br>
    </br>
    (<i>Note: when pasting in the connection string, you will need to replace part of the connection string where it says '{your_password}' with your Azure SQL Server password</i>)
   </details>

3. Open the generated `local.settings.json` file and in the `Values` section verify you have the below. If not, add the below and replace `{connection_string}` with your connection string from the previous step:

    ```json
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
    "AzureWebJobsDashboard": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
    "SqlConnectionString": "{connection_string}"
    ```
