## Contributor Getting Started

### SQL Setup

In order to test changes it is suggested that you have a SQL server set up to connect to and run queries against. Instructions to set this up can be found in the [Quick Start Guide](./docs/GeneralSetup.md)

### Set Up Development Environment

1. [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

2. Clone repo and open in VS Code:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-sql-extension
   cd azure-functions-sql-extension
   code .
   ```
3. Install extensions when prompted after VS Code opens
   - Note: This includes the Azure Functions, C#, and editorconfig extensions

4. Configure the Function App located in the [samples](./samples) folder by following the instructions [here](./docs/GeneralSetup.md#configure-function-app)

5. Configure a local nuget source that will be used to build the .NET Out-of-Proc sample with the latest locally built extension package.

   Building the sample will cause a project to be created and built in the temp directory, which means it does not pick up on the nuget.config for this project. Without adding the source at the global level that project will fail to build since it will be looking for the dev-local version of the package (99.99.99).

   Note: This command must be ran from your **home directory** (or a directory outside the project repo).
    ```powershell
    dotnet nuget add source <PATH_TO_REPO_AZURE-FUNCTIONS-SQL-EXTENSION/local-packages>
    ```

6. Press F5 to run SQL bindings samples that are included in this repo. The output window should display startup information as well as the function endpoints that were started.
